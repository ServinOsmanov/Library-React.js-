        "Author": "Chinua Achebe",
        "Biography":`Chinua Achebe was born on the 16 of November, 1930. Achebe's parents, Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi
                    Iloegbunam, were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria. The elder Achebe stopped 
                    practicing the religion of his ancestors, but he respected its traditions. Achebe's unabbreviated name, Chinualumogu 
                    ("May God fight on my behalf"), was a prayer for divine protection and stability.His first novel was called "Things 
                    Fall Apart" (1958), and his last was "Anthills of Savannah"(1987). The Achebe family had five other surviving children, 
                    named in a similar fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion: Frank Okwuofu, John Chukwuemeka 
                    Ifeanyichukwu, Zinobia Uzoma, Augustine Ndubisi, and Grace Nwanneka.

                    <h3>Early life</h3><br>
                    Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930.Isaiah Okafo Achebe and 
                    Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a 
                    significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to 
                    Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra.<br>
                    <br>
                    Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister 
                    Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages 
                    his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books – including a prose adaptation of A 
                    Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Chinua also eagerly anticipated 
                    traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <br>
                    In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for 
                    young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One 
                    teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended 
                    Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy 
                    erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. 
                    Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the age of 12, Achebe moved away from his family to the village of Nekede, four kilometres from Owerri. He enrolled 
                    as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught. In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for 
                    Mbari, a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of 
                    sculpture and collage. (He would later suggest the name for the Mbari Writers and Artists Club that was founded 
                    in Ibadan by Ulli Beier and others in 1961.) When the time came to change to secondary school, in 1944, Achebe 
                    sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha and the 
                    even more prestigious Government College in Umuahia.<br>
                    <br>
                    Modeled on the British public school, and funded by the colonial administration, Government College was established in 
                    1929 to educate Nigeria's future elite. It had rigorous academic standards and was vigorously elitist, accepting boys 
                    purely on the basis of ability. The language of the school was English, not only to develop proficiency but also to 
                    provide a common tongue for pupils from different Nigerian language groups. Achebe described this later as being ordered 
                    to "put away their different mother tongues and communicate in the language of their colonisers". The rule was strictly 
                    enforced and Achebe recalls that his first punishment was for asking another boy to pass the soap in Igbo.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in his first year, completing the first two years' studies in one, and spending 
                    only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five. Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen 
                    and belonged instead to a group of six exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster 
                    banned the reading of textbooks from five to six o'clock in the afternoon (though other activities and other books were 
                    allowed).<br>
                    <br>
                    Achebe started to explore the school's "wonderful library".There he discovered Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery 
                    (1901), the autobiography of an American former slave; Achebe "found it sad, but it showed him another dimension of 
                    reality". He also read classic novels, such as Gulliver's Travels (1726), David Copperfield (1850), and Treasure 
                    Island (1883), together with tales of colonial derring-do such as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain (1887) and John 
                    Buchan's Prester John (1910). Achebe later recalled that, as a reader, he "took sides with the white characters against 
                    the savages" and even developed a dislike for Africans. "The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and 
                    courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or, at the most, cunning. I hated their guts."<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>University</h3>
                    <br>
                    In 1948, in preparation for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University 
                    of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance 
                    examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine.
                    It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading 
                    Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British 
                    storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he 
                    decided to become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author's cultural 
                    ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is 
                    shot.<br>
                    <br>
                    He abandoned the study of medicine and changed to English, history, and theology. Because he switched his field, however, 
                    he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government bursary, and his family also donated money – 
                    his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies.
                    From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These 
                    include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, poet and playwright John Pepper Clark, and poet Christopher Okigbo. Elechi Amadi is also 
                    another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although he was in the faculty of sciences.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1950 Achebe wrote a piece for the University Herald entitled "Polar Undergraduate", his debut as an author. It used irony 
                    and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates. He followed this with other essays and letters about 
                    philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine, The Bug. He served as the 
                    Herald's editor during the 1951–52 school year.<br>
                    <br>
                    While at the university, Achebe wrote his first short story, "In a Village Church", which combines details of life in rural 
                    Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons, a style which appears in many of his later works. Other short stories he 
                    wrote during his time at Ibadan (including "The Old Order in Conflict with the New" and "Dead Men's Path") examine conflicts 
                    between tradition and modernity, with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides. When a professor named 
                    Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach comparative religion, Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian 
                    history and African traditional religions.<br>
                    <br>
                    After the final examinations at Ibadan in 1953, Achebe was awarded a second-class degree. Rattled by not receiving the highest 
                    level, he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation. He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Marriage and family</h3>
                    <br>
                    In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern 
                    region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana 
                    Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when 
                    she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, 
                    Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was 
                    pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.<br>
                    <br>
                    Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years, and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of 
                    Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan. Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and 
                    mutual understanding; some tension arose early in their union, due to conflicts about attention and communication. However, 
                    as their relationship matured, husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another.<br>
                    <br>
                    Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and 
                    another boy named Chidi, on 24 May 1967. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried 
                    about the world view – especially with regard to race – expressed at the school, especially through the mostly white 
                    teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life. In 1966, Achebe published his first children's book, 
                    Chike and the River, to address some of these concerns. After the Biafran War, the Achebes had another daughter on 7 March 
                    1970, named Nwando. When asked about his family Achebe stated: "There are few things more important than my family." 
                    They have six grandchildren: Chochi, Chino, Chidera, C.J. (Chinua Jr.), Nnamdi and Zeal.`,

        "Author": "Hans Christian Andersen",
        "Biography": `<br>
                    <br>
                    Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805. He was an only child. Andersen's father, 
                    also Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family 
                    had belonged to a higher social class, but investigations have disproved these stories). A persistent speculation 
                    suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII, but this notion has been challenged.<br>
                    <br>
                    Andersen's father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced Andersen to literature, reading to him 
                    Arabian Nights. Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an uneducated washerwoman. Following her husband's death 
                    in 1816, she remarried in 1818. Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education 
                    and had to support himself, working as an apprentice to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to 
                    Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, 
                    but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion 
                    seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a grammar school in 
                    Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of the youth's education. Andersen had by then published his first 
                    story, "The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave (1822)." Though not a stellar pupil, he also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.<br>
                    <br>
                    He later said his years in school were the darkest and most bitter of his life. At one school, he lived at his 
                    schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was "to improve his character." He later said the faculty had 
                    discouraged him from writing, driving him into a depression.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Early work</h3>
                    <br>
                    A very early fairy tale by Andersen, "The Tallow Candle" (Danish: Tællelyset), was discovered in a Danish archive in 
                    October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, was about a candle that did not feel appreciated. It was written while 
                    Andersen was still in school and dedicated to a benefactor in whose family's possession it remained until it turned up 
                    among other family papers in a local archive.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point 
                    of Amager." Its protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a 
                    theatrical piece, Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower, and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and 
                    publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the 
                    first of many journeys through Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story "Agnete and the Merman." 
                    He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante the same year, inspiring the title of "The Bay of Fables."
                    In October 1834, he arrived in Rome. Andersen's travels in Italy were to be reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized 
                    autobiography titled The Improvisatore (Improvisatoren), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.[citation needed]<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Fairy tales and poetry</h3>
                    <br>
                    Andersen's initial attempts at writing fairy tales were revisions of stories that he heard as a child. Initially his 
                    original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen 
                    published the first two installments of his Fairy Tales (Danish: Eventyr; lit. "fantastic tales"). More stories, completing 
                    the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including "The Tinderbox," "The Princess and 
                    the Pea," "Thumbelina," "The Little Mermaid," and "The Emperor's New Clothes." The quality of these stories was not 
                    immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, O.T. (1836) 
                    and Only a Fiddler (1837); the latter work was reviewed by a young Søren Kierkegaard.<br>
                    <br>
                    After a visit to Sweden in 1837, Andersen became inspired by Scandinavism and committed himself to writing a poem that would 
                    convey the relatedness of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians. In July 1839, during a visit to the island of Funen, Andersen wrote 
                    the text of his poem Jeg er en Skandinav ("I am a Scandinavian") to capture "the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three 
                    sister nations have gradually grown together" as part of a Scandinavian national anthem. Composer Otto Lindblad set the poem 
                    to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<br>

                    Andersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. 
                    First Booklet (Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling), which consists of "The Daisy," "The Steadfast Tin Soldier," and "The 
                    Wild Swans."<br>
                    <br>
                    1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four translations of his fairy tales. "The Little Mermaid" 
                    appeared in the periodical Bentley's Miscellany, followed by a second volume, Wonderful Stories for Children. Two other 
                    volumes enthusiastically received were A Danish Story Book and Danish Fairy Tales and Legends. A review that appeared in the 
                    London journal The Athenæum (February 1846) said of Wonderful Stories, "This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for 
                    grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand."<br>
                    <br>
                    Andersen would continue to write fairy tales and published them in installments until 1872.[citation needed]<br>

                    <h3>Death</h3>
                    <br>
                    In the spring of 1872, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt; he never fully recovered from the resultant 
                    injuries. Soon afterward, he started to show signs of liver cancer.<br>
                    <br>
                    He died on 4 August 1875, in a house called Rolighed (literally: calmness), near Copenhagen, the home of his close 
                    friends, the banker Moritz Melchior and his wife. Shortly before his death, Andersen had consulted a composer about 
                    the music for his funeral, saying: "Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep 
                    time with little steps." His body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen, in the 
                    family plot of the Collins. However in 1914 the stone was moved to another cemetery (today known as "Frederiksbergs 
                    ældre kirkegaard"), where younger Collin family members were buried. For a period, his, Edvard Collin's and Henriette 
                    Collin's graves were unmarked. A second stone has been erected, marking H.C. Andersen's grave, now without any mention 
                    of the Collin couple, but all three still share the same plot.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the time of his death, Andersen was internationally revered, and the Danish Government paid him an annual stipend 
                    as a "national treasure"`,

                        for greater things, that he cannot appreciate living in the moment. The tale was first 
                        published 21 December 1844 with "The Snow Queen", in Copenhagen, Denmark, by C.A. Reitzel. 
                        One scholar (Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager) indicates that "The Fir-Tree" was the 
                        first of Andersen's fairy tales to express a deep pessimism.`

        "Author": "Dante Alighieri",
        "Biography": `<h3>Early life</h3>
                    <br>
                    Dante was born in Florence, Republic of Florence, present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, 
                    although it is generally believed[by whom?] to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions 
                    in the Divine Comedy. Its first section, the Inferno, begins, "Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita" ("Midway upon 
                    the journey of our life"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to 
                    the Bible (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the nether world took place in 
                    1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the Paradiso section of the Divine Comedy also provide 
                    a possible clue that he was born under the sign of Gemini: "As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, 
                    from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious" (XXII 151–154). In 1265, the sun was 
                    in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 (Julian calendar).<br>
                    <br>
                    Dante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (Inferno, XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could 
                    mention by name was Cacciaguida degli Elisei (Paradiso, XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, 
                    Alaghiero or Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle 
                    of Montaperti in the middle of the 13th century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some 
                    protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing 
                    that he was not considered worth exiling.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dante's family had loyalties to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the Papacy and which was involved in 
                    complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a 
                    member of the Abati family. She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa 
                    di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such 
                    matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). 
                    When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the 
                    powerful Donati family. Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including 
                    contracts signed before a notary. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, Beatrice Portinari (known also as 
                    Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; 
                    he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not 
                    known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).<br>
                    <br>
                    Dante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289). This victory brought about a reformation of 
                    the Florentine constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan 
                    guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded 
                    as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the 
                    years 1298–1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.<br>
                    <br>
                    Gemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that 
                    only Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister 
                    Beatrice.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Education and poetry</h3>
                    <br>
                    Not much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or 
                    monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet 
                    Guido Guinizelli—whom in Purgatorio XXVI he characterized as his "father"—at a time when the Sicilian school (Scuola poetica 
                    Siciliana), a cultural group from Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the Provençal 
                    poetry of the troubadours, such as Arnaut Daniel, and the Latin writers of classical antiquity, including Cicero, Ovid and 
                    especially Virgil.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dante said he first met Beatrice Portinari, daughter of Folco Portinari, at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with 
                    her "at first sight", apparently without even talking with her. He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings 
                    in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called courtly love, a phenomenon developed in 
                    French and Provençal poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was 
                    unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the dolce stil novo (sweet new style, a term which 
                    Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects 
                    of love (Amore). Love for Beatrice (as Petrarch would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry 
                    and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him 
                    constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin 
                    literature. The Convivio chronicles his having read Boethius's De consolatione philosophiae and Cicero's De Amicitia. He then 
                    dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella. He took part 
                    in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders (Franciscan and Dominican) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, 
                    the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. Bonaventure, the latter expounding on the theories of St. 
                    Thomas Aquinas.<br>
                    <br>
                    At 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini; together they became the 
                    leaders of the dolce stil novo. Brunetto later received special mention in the Divine Comedy (Inferno, XV, 28) for what he 
                    had taught Dante: Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most 
                    eminent companions. Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called Rime, rhymes), others being included 
                    in the later Vita Nuova and Convivio. Other studies are reported, or deduced from Vita Nuova or the Comedy, regarding 
                    painting and music.<br>`,

        "Biography": `<h3>Family</h3>
                    <br>
                    Jane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her 
                    father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother "certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago". He 
                    added that her arrival was particularly welcome as "a future companion to her sister". The winter of 1776 was particularly 
                    harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.<br>
                    <br>
                    For much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731–1805) served as the rector of the Anglican parishes at Steventon, and a 
                    nearby Deane. He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of 
                    eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and 
                    his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find 
                    a husband and George entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827).
                    She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the 
                    gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition 
                    that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot.<br>
                    <br>
                    George and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time. George received the living for 
                    the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated 
                    farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 
                    1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by license, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day.<br>
                    <br>
                    Their income was modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the expectation of a small inheritance at the 
                    time of her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 
                    16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at 
                    Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and 
                    then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Steventon</h3>
                    <br>
                    In 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to born there, in 1771. At about this 
                    time Cassandra could no longer ignore that George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been 
                    deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and 
                    Jane in 1775.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to Honan, life in the Austen home was lived in "an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere" where the ideas of 
                    those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.The family relied on the 
                    patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London 
                    with George's sister, Philadelphia and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter 
                    Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, "the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid 
                    solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, 
                    together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful 
                    horizon and influence her later life and works."<br>

                    Cassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and '80s, inviting young Cassie to visit them 
                    in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return, "... and almost home they were when they 
                    met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the 
                    pleasure of riding home in it." Le Faye writes that, "Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. 
                    Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to 
                    have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other."<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <br>
                    In 1783 Jane and Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when 
                    she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Jane nearly died. 
                    Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the 
                    Abbey School House, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum 
                    probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before 
                    December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austens family. After 1786, Austen "never 
                    again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment".<br>
                    <br>
                    The remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins believes 
                    that Austen "used some of the same school books as the boys" her father tutored. Austen apparently had unfettered access 
                    both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large 
                    and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both 
                    sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Private theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a 
                    series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's The Rivals (1775) and David Garrick's Bon Ton. Jane's 
                    eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and Jane probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator 
                    and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. 
                    At the age of 12, Jane tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.`,

        "Author": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac",
        "Biography": `<h3>Family</h3>
                    <br>
                    Honoré de Balzac was born into a family which through its industry and efforts aspired to achieve respectability. 
                    His father, born Bernard-François Balssa, was one of eleven children from an artisan family in Tarn, a region in the 
                    south of France. In 1760 he set off for Paris with only a Louis coin in his pocket, intent on improving his social 
                    standing; by 1776 he had become Secretary to the King's Council and a Freemason (he had also changed his name to the 
                    more noble sounding "Balzac," his son later adding—without official recognition—the nobiliary particle: "de"). After 
                    the Reign of Terror (1793–94), François Balzac was despatched to Tours to coordinate supplies for the Army.<br>
                    <br>
                    Balzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, came from a family of haberdashers in Paris. Her family's wealth 
                    was a considerable factor in the match: she was eighteen at the time of the wedding, and François Balzac fifty. As the 
                    author and literary critic Sir Victor Pritchett explained, "She was certainly drily aware that she had been given to an 
                    old husband as a reward for his professional services to a friend of her family and that the capital was on her side. She 
                    was not in love with her husband".<br>
                    <br>
                    Honoré (named after Saint-Honoré of Amiens, who is commemorated on 16 May, four days before Balzac's birthday) was actually 
                    the second child born to the Balzacs; exactly one year previous, Louis-Daniel had been born, but he lived for only a month. 
                    Honoré's sisters Laure and Laurence were born in 1800 and 1802, and his younger brother Henry-François in 1807.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Early life</h3>
                    <br>
                    As an infant Balzac was sent to a wet-nurse; the following year he was joined by his sister Laure and they spent four 
                    years away from home.(Although Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau's influential book Émile convinced many mothers 
                    of the time to nurse their own children, sending babies to wet-nurses was still common among the middle and upper classes.) 
                    When the Balzac children returned home, they were kept at a frosty distance from their parents, which affected the author-to-
                    be significantly. His 1835 novel Le Lys dans la Vallée features a cruel governess named Miss Caroline, modeled after his own 
                    caregiver.<br>
                    <br>
                    At age ten Balzac was sent to the Oratorian grammar school in Vendôme, where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking 
                    to instill the same hardscrabble work ethic which had gained him the esteem of society, intentionally gave little spending 
                    money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.<br>
                    <br>
                    Balzac had difficulty adapting to the rote style of learning at the school. As a result, he was frequently sent to the 
                    "alcove", a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students. (The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered 
                    Honoré, replied: "Remember M. Balzac? I should think I do! I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon more than a 
                    hundred times!") Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.<br>
                    <br>
                    Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood—as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him—into La 
                    Comédie Humaine. His time at Vendôme is reflected in Louis Lambert, his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an 
                    Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : "He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately 
                    on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had told me that he found indescribable delight 
                    in reading dictionaries for lack of other books."<br>
                    <br>
                    Balzac often fell ill, finally causing the headmaster to contact his family with news of a "sort of a coma". When he returned 
                    home, his grandmother said: "Voilà donc comme le collège nous renvoie les jolis que nous lui envoyons!" ("Look how the 
                    academy returns the pretty ones we send them!") Balzac himself attributed his condition to "intellectual congestion", but 
                    his extended confinement in the "alcove" was surely a factor. (Meanwhile, his father had been writing a treatise on "the 
                    means of preventing thefts and murders, and of restoring the men who commit them to a useful role in society", in which he 
                    heaped disdain on prison as a form of crime prevention.)<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris, and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years. 
                    This was an unhappy time in his life, during which he attempted suicide on a bridge over the Loire River.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1816 Balzac entered the Sorbonne, where he studied under three famous professors: François Guizot, who later became 
                    Prime Minister, was Professor of Modern History; Abel-François Villemain, a recent arrival from the Collège Charlemagne, 
                    lectured on French and classical literature; and, most influential of all, Victor Cousin's courses on philosophy encouraged 
                    his students to think independently.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once his studies were completed, Balzac was persuaded by his father to follow him into the Law; for three years he trained 
                    and worked at the office of Victor Passez, a family friend. During this time Balzac began to understand the vagaries of 
                    human nature. In his 1840 novel Le Notaire, he wrote that a young person in the legal profession sees "the oily wheels of 
                    every fortune, the hideous wrangling of heirs over corpses not yet cold, the human heart grappling with the Penal Code."<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1819 Passez offered to make Balzac his successor, but his apprentice had had enough of the Law. He despaired of being "
                    a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. 
                    And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same thing over and over again.... I am hungry and 
                    nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.<br>
                    <br>
                    The loss of this opportunity caused serious discord in the Balzac household, although Honoré was not turned away entirely. 
                    Instead, in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital – as English critic George Saintsbury describes it – 
                    "in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion, with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him", while 
                    the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [32 km] outside Paris.`,

                        obsessions against them. The novel exemplifies what Henry James described as Balzac’s “huge, all-compassing,

        "Author": "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
        "Biography": `<br>
                    <br>
                    Fyodor Dostoyevsky, born on 11 November [O.S. 30 October] 1821, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoyevsky and Maria 
                    Dostoyevskaya (née Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the 
                    Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow. Dostoyevsky encountered the patients, who 
                    were at the lower end of the Russian social scale when playing in the hospital gardens.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dostoyevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, fairy tales 
                    and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and love for fictionlize 
                    stories. When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide 
                    range of literature, including Russian writers Karamzin, Pushkin and Derzhavin; Gothic fiction such as Ann Radcliffe; 
                    romantic works by Schiller and Goethe; heroic tales by Cervantes and Walter Scott; and Homer's epics. Although his father's 
                    approach to education has been described as strict and harsh, Dostoyevsky himself reports that his imagination was brought 
                    alive by nightly readings by his parents.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, 
                    he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature 
                    man for a young girl appears in The Devils, The Brothers Karamazov, and other writings. An incident involving a family 
                    servant, or serf, in the estate in Darovoye, is described in "The Peasant Marey": when the young Dostoyevsky imagines 
                    hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Although Dostoyevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn and cheeky. 
                    In 1833, Dostoyevsky's father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak 
                    boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic. To pay the school fees, 
                    his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoyevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic 
                    classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably The Adolescent.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Youth</h3>
                    <br>
                    On 27 September 1837 Dostoyevsky's mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoyevsky and 
                    his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers 
                    to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoyevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the 
                    help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to the Academy in Reval, Estonia.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dostoyevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering 
                    and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend Konstantin Trutovsky once said, "There was no student in the 
                    entire institution with less of a military bearing than F. M. Dostoyevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung 
                    awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a 
                    time and which lay heavily on him." Dostoyevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he 
                    showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption 
                    among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected 
                    by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname "Monk Photius".<br>
                    <br>
                    Signs of Dostoyevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839, although 
                    the reports of a seizure originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by Sigmund Freud.) which are 
                    now considered to be unreliable. His father's official cause of death was an apoplectic stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel 
                    Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to Siberia, Khotiaintsev 
                    would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in Tula, but Dostoyevsky's 
                    brother Andrei perpetuated the story. After his father's death, Dostoyevsky continued his studies, passed his exams 
                    and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and 
                    frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling.<br>

                    On 12 August 1843 Dostoyevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by 
                    Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as "no less good-natured and no less courteous than his 
                    brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, 
                    and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness". Dostoyevsky's first completed 
                    literary work, a translation of Honoré de Balzac's novel Eugénie Grandet, was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th 
                    and 7th volume of the journal Repertoire and Pantheon, followed by several other translations. None were successful, and 
                    his financial difficulties led him to write a novel.<br>`,

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The details of Boccaccio's birth are uncertain. He was born in Florence or in a village near Certaldo 
                    where his family was from.He was the son of Florentine merchant Boccaccino di Chellino and an unknown woman; 
                    he was likely born out of wedlock. Boccaccio's stepmother was called Margherita de' Mardoli.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Early life</h3>
                    <br>
                    Boccaccio grew up in Florence. His father worked for the Compagnia dei Bardi and, in the 1320s, married 
                    Margherita dei Mardoli, who was of a well-to-do family. Boccaccio may have been tutored by Giovanni Mazzuoli and 
                    received from him an early introduction to the works of Dante. In 1326, his father was appointed head of a bank and 
                    moved with his family to Naples. Boccaccio was an apprentice at the bank but disliked the banking profession. 
                    He persuaded his father to let him study law at the Studium[4] (the present-day University of Naples), where he 
                    studied canon law for the next six years. He also pursued his interest in scientific and literary studies.<br>
                    <br>
                    His father introduced him to the Neapolitan nobility and the French-influenced court of Robert the Wise (the king of Naples)
                    in the 1330s. At this time, he fell in love with a married daughter of the king, who is portrayed as "Fiammetta" in many of 
                    Boccaccio's prose romances, including Il Filocolo (1338). Boccaccio became a friend of fellow Florentine Niccolò Acciaioli, 
                    and benefited from his influence as the administrator, and perhaps the lover, of Catherine of Valois-Courtenay, widow of 
                    Philip I of Taranto. Acciaioli later became counselor to Queen Joanna I of Naples and, eventually, her Grand Seneschal.<br>
                    <br>
                    It seems that Boccaccio enjoyed law no more than banking, but his studies allowed him the opportunity to study widely and 
                    make good contacts with fellow scholars. His early influences included Paolo da Perugia (a curator and author of a collection 
                    of myths called the Collectiones), humanists Barbato da Sulmona and Giovanni Barrili, and theologian Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Adult years</h3>
                    <br>
                    In Naples, Boccaccio began what he considered his true vocation of poetry. Works produced in this period include Il Filostrato and 
                    Teseida (the sources for Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde and The Knight's Tale, respectively), The Filocolo (a prose version of an 
                    existing French romance), and La caccia di Diana (a poem in terza rima listing Neapolitan women). The period featured considerable 
                    formal innovation, including possibly the introduction of the Sicilian octave, where it influenced Petrarch.<br>
                    <br>
                    Boccaccio returned to Florence in early 1341, avoiding the plague of 1340 in that city, but also missing the visit of Petrarch to 
                    Naples in 1341. He had left Naples due to tensions between the Angevin king and Florence. His father had returned to Florence in 
                    1338, where he had gone bankrupt. His mother died shortly afterward (possibly, as she was unknown — see above). Boccaccio continued 
                    to work, although dissatisfied with his return to Florence, producing Comedia delle ninfe fiorentine in 1341 (also known as Ameto), 
                    a mix of prose and poems, completing the fifty-canto allegorical poem Amorosa visione in 1342, and Fiammetta in 1343. The pastoral 
                    piece "Ninfale fiesolano" probably dates from this time, also. In 1343, Boccaccio's father remarried to Bice del Bostichi. His children 
                    by his first marriage had all died, but he had another son named Iacopo in 1344.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Florence, the overthrow of Walter of Brienne brought about the government of popolo minuto ("small people", workers). 
                    It diminished the influence of the nobility and the wealthier merchant classes and assisted in the relative decline of 
                    Florence. The city was hurt further in 1348 by the Black Death, which killed some three-quarters of the city's population, 
                    later represented in the Decameron.<br>
                    <br>
                    From 1347, Boccaccio spent much time in Ravenna, seeking new patronage and, despite his claims, it is not certain whether 
                    he was present in plague-ravaged Florence. His stepmother died during the epidemic and his father was closely associated 
                    with the government efforts as Minister of Supply in the city. His father died in 1349 and Boccaccio was forced into a more 
                    active role as head of the family.<br>
                    <br>
                    Boccaccio began work on The Decameron around 1349. It is probable that the structures of many of the tales date from 
                    earlier in his career, but the choice of a hundred tales and the frame-story lieta brigata of three men and seven women 
                    dates from this time. The work was largely complete by 1352. It was Boccaccio's final effort in literature and one of his 
                    last works in Italian; the only other substantial work was Corbaccio (dated to either 1355 or 1365). Boccaccio revised and 
                    rewrote the Decameron in 1370–1371. This manuscript has survived to the present day.<br>
                    <br>
                    From 1350, Boccaccio became closely involved with Italian humanism (although less of a scholar) and also with the 
                    Florentine government. His first official mission was to Romagna in late 1350. He revisited that city-state twice and 
                    also was sent to Brandenburg, Milan and Avignon. He also pushed for the study of Greek, housing Barlaam of Calabria, and 
                    encouraging his tentative translations of works by Homer, Euripides, and Aristotle. In these years, he also took minor 
                    orders.<br>
                    <br>
                    In October 1350, he was delegated to greet Francesco Petrarch as he entered Florence and also to have Petrarch as a guest 
                    at Boccaccio's home, during his stay. The meeting between the two was extremely fruitful and they were friends from then 
                    on, Boccaccio calling Petrarch his teacher and magister. Petrarch at that time encouraged Boccaccio to study classical 
                    Greek and Latin literature. They met again in Padua in 1351, Boccaccio on an official mission to invite Petrarch to take 
                    a chair at the university in Florence. Although unsuccessful, the discussions between the two were instrumental in 
                    Boccaccio writing the Genealogia deorum gentilium; the first edition was completed in 1360 and this remained one of the 
                    key reference works on classical mythology for over 400 years. It served as an extended defense for the studies of ancient 
                    literature and thought. Despite the Pagan beliefs at its core, Boccaccio believed that much could be learned from antiquity. 
                    Thus, he challenged the arguments of clerical intellectuals who wanted to limit access to classical sources to prevent any 
                    moral harm to Christian readers. The revival of classical antiquity became a foundation of the Renaissance, and his defense of 
                    the importance of ancient literature was an essential requirement for its development.The discussions also formalized 
                    Boccaccio's poetic ideas. Certain sources also see a conversion of Boccaccio by Petrarch from the open humanist of the 
                    Decameron to a more ascetic style, closer to the dominant fourteenth century ethos. For example, he followed Petrarch 
                    (and Dante) in the unsuccessful championing of an archaic and deeply allusive form of Latin poetry. In 1359, following a 
                    meeting with Pope Innocent VI and further meetings with Petrarch, it is probable that Boccaccio took some kind of religious 
                    mantle. There is a persistent (but unsupported) tale that he repudiated his earlier works as profane in 1362, including the 
                    Decameron.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1360, Boccaccio began work on De mulieribus claris, a book offering biographies of one hundred and six famous women, 
                    that he completed in 1374.<br>
                    <br>
                    A number of Boccaccio's close friends and other acquaintances were executed or exiled in the purge following the failed 
                    coup of 1361. It was in this year that Boccaccio left Florence to reside in Certaldo, although not directly linked to the 
                    conspiracy, where he became less involved in government affairs. He did not undertake further missions for Florence 
                    until 1365, and traveled to Naples and then on to Padua and Venice, where he met up with Petrarch in grand style at 
                    Palazzo Molina, Petrarch's residence as well as the place of Petrarch's library. He later returned to Certaldo. 
                    He met Petrarch only once again in Padua in 1368. Upon hearing of the death of Petrarch (19 July 1374), Boccaccio wrote a 
                    commemorative poem, including it in his collection of lyric poems, the Rime.<br>
                    <br>
                    He returned to work for the Florentine government in 1365, undertaking a mission to Pope Urban V. The papacy returned to 
                    Rome from Avignon in 1367, and Boccaccio was again sent to Urban, offering congratulations. He also undertook diplomatic 
                    missions to Venice and Naples.<br>
                    <br>
                    Of his later works, the moralistic biographies gathered as De casibus virorum illustrium (1355–74) and De mulieribus 
                    claris (1361–1375) were most significant. Other works include a dictionary of geographical allusions in classical 
                    literature, De montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis seu paludibus, et de nominibus maris liber. 
                    He gave a series of lectures on Dante at the Santo Stefano church in 1373 and these resulted in his final major work, 
                    the detailed Esposizioni sopra la Commedia di Dante.Boccaccio and Petrarch were also two of the most educated people 
                    in early Renaissance in the field of archaeology.<br>
                    <br>
                    Boccaccio's change in writing style in the 1350s was due in part to meeting with Petrarch, but it was mostly due to poor 
                    health and a premature weakening of his physical strength. It also was due to disappointments in love. Some such 
                    disappointment could explain why Boccaccio came suddenly to write in a bitter Corbaccio style, having previously written 
                    always in praise of women and love. Petrarch describes how Pietro Petrone (a Carthusian monk) on his death bed in 1362 
                    sent another Carthusian (Gioacchino Ciani) to urge him to renounce his worldly studies. Petrarch then dissuaded Boccaccio 
                    from burning his own works and selling off his personal library, letters, books, and manuscripts. Petrarch even offered 
                    to purchase Boccaccio's library, so that it would become part of Petrarch's library. However, upon Boccaccio's death, his 
                    entire collection was given to the monastery of Santo Spirito, in Florence, where it still resides.<br>
                    <br>
                    His final years were troubled by illnesses, some relating to obesity and what often is described as dropsy, severe edema 
                    that would be described today as congestive heart failure. He died on 21 December 1375 in Certaldo, where he is buried.`,

                        The book is structured as a frame story containing 100 tales told by a group of seven young women and three 
                        young men sheltering in a secluded villa just outside Florence to escape the Black Death, which was afflicting 
                        the city. Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. 
                        The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, 
                        and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence 
                        (for example on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time. Written in the 
                        vernacular of the Florentine language, it is considered a masterpiece of classical early Italian prose.`

        "Biography": `<h3>Early life and education</h3>
                    <br>
                    Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo was born into an educated middle-class family on 24 August 1899. They were 
                    in comfortable circumstances but not wealthy enough to live in downtown Buenos Aires so the family resided in Palermo, 
                    then a poorer suburb. Borges's mother, Leonor Acevedo Suárez, came from a traditional Uruguayan family of criollo 
                    (Spanish) origin. Her family had been much involved in the European settling of South America and the Argentine War 
                    of Independence, and she spoke often of their heroic actions.<br>
                    <br>
                    His 1929 book, Cuaderno San Martín, includes the poem "Isidoro Acevedo", commemorating his grandfather, Isidoro de Acevedo 
                    Laprida, a soldier of the Buenos Aires Army. A descendant of the Argentine lawyer and politician Francisco Narciso de 
                    Laprida, de Acevedo Laprida fought in the battles of Cepeda in 1859, Pavón in 1861, and Los Corrales in 1880. De Acevedo 
                    Laprida died of pulmonary congestion in the house where his grandson Jorge Luis Borges was born.<br>
                    <br>
                    Borges's own father, Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam (24 February 1874 – 14 February 1938) was a lawyer, and wrote a novel 
                    El caudillo in 1921. Borges Haslam was born in Entre Rios of Spanish, Portuguese, and English descent, the son of Francisco 
                    Borges Lafinur, a colonel, and Frances Ann Haslam, an Englishwoman. Borges Haslam grew up speaking English at home. The 
                    family frequently traveled to Europe. Borges Haslam wed Leonor Acevedo Suarez in 1898 and was also father of the painter 
                    Norah Borges, sister of Jorge Luis Borges.<br>
                    <br>
                    At age nine, Jorge Luis Borges translated Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince into Spanish. It was published in a local journal, 
                    but Borges' friends thought the real author was his father. Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured 
                    literary aspirations. Borges said his father "tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt", despite the 1921 opus 
                    El caudillo. Jorge Luis Borges wrote, "as most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I felt ashamed, 
                    quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action."<br>
                    <br>
                    Jorge Luis Borges was taught at home until the age of 11, was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the 
                    latter at the age of twelve. The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one thousand volumes; 
                    Borges would later remark that "if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say my father's library."<br>
                    <br>
                    His father gave up practicing law due to the failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son. In 1914, the family 
                    moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe. Borges Haslam was treated by a Geneva eye specialist, 
                    while Jorge Luis and his sister Norah attended school; there Jorge Luis learned French. He read Thomas Carlyle in English, 
                    and he began to read philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met the writer Maurice Abramowicz and began 
                    a literary friendship that would last for the rest of his life. He received his baccalauréat from the Collège de Genève 
                    in 1918. The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during 
                    the war, staying until 1921. After World War I, the family spent three years living in various cities: Lugano, Barcelona, 
                    Majorca, Seville, and Madrid.<br>
                    <br>
                    At that time, Borges discovered the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer and Gustav Meyrink's The Golem (1915) which became 
                    influential to his work. In Spain, Borges fell in with and became a member of the avant-garde, anti-Modernismo Ultraist 
                    literary movement, inspired by Guillaume Apollinaire and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, close to the Imagists. His first 
                    poem, "Hymn to the Sea," written in the style of Walt Whitman, was published in the magazine Grecia. While in Spain, 
                    he met such noted Spanish writers as Rafael Cansinos Assens and Ramón Gómez de la Serna.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Death</h3>
                    <br>
                    During his final days in Geneva, Borges began brooding about the possibility of an afterlife. Although calm and collected 
                    about his own death, Borges began probing Kodama as to whether she inclined more towards the Shinto beliefs of her 
                    father or the Catholicism of her mother. Kodama "had always regarded Borges as an Agnostic, as she was herself", but 
                    given the insistence of his questioning, she offered to call someone more "qualified". Borges responded, "You are 
                    asking me if I want a priest." He then instructed her to call two clergymen, a Catholic priest, in memory of his mother, 
                    and a Protestant minister, in memory of his English grandmother. He was visited first by Father Pierre Jacquet and by 
                    Pastor Edouard de Montmollin.<br>
                    <br>
                    Borges died of liver cancer on 14 June 1986, aged 86, in Geneva. His burial was preceded by an ecumenical service at the 
                    Protestant Cathédrale de Saint Pierre on 18 June. With many Swiss and Argentine dignitaries present, Pastor de Montmollin 
                    read the First Chapter of St. John's Gospel. He then preached that "Borges was a man who had unceasingly searched for the 
                    right word, the term that could sum up the whole, the final meaning of things." He explained, however, that no man can 
                    reach that word through his own efforts and in trying becomes lost in a labyrinth. Pastor de Montmollin concluded, 
                    "It is not man who discovers the word, it is the Word that comes to him."<br>
                    <br>
                    Father Jacquet also preached, saying that, when visiting Borges before his death, he had found "a man full of love, who 
                    received from the Church the forgiveness of his sins". After the funeral, Borges was laid to rest in Geneva's Cimetière 
                    de Plainpalais. His grave, marked by a rough-hewn headstone, is adorned with carvings derived from Anglo-Saxon and Old 
                    Norse art and literature.`,

                        by James E. Irby, that, like the translation into English of Ficciones, appeared in 1962. Together, 
                        these two translations led to much of Borges's worldwide fame in the 1960s. Several stories appear in both

                        a theme in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius", but here Borges takes it to another level: the manifestation of human

        "Biography": `<h3>Early life and education</h3>
                    <br>
                    Emily Brontë was born on 30 July 1818 in the village of Thornton on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of 
                    Yorkshire, in Northern England, to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Brontë. She was the younger sister of 
                    Charlotte Brontë and the fifth of six children. In 1820, shortly after the birth of Emily's younger sister Anne, the 
                    family moved eight miles away to Haworth, where Patrick was employed as perpetual curate; here the children developed 
                    their literary talents.<br>
                    <br>
                    After the death of their mother on 15 September 1821 from cancer, when Emily was three years old, the older sisters Maria, 
                    Elizabeth and Charlotte were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, where they encountered abuse and 
                    privations later described by Charlotte in Jane Eyre. At the age of six on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at 
                    school for a brief period. When a typhoid epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth caught it. Maria, who may actually 
                    have had tuberculosis, was sent home, where she died. Emily was subsequently removed from the school, in June 1825, along 
                    with Charlotte and Elizabeth. Elizabeth died soon after their return home.<br>
                    <br>
                    The three remaining sisters and their brother Patrick Branwell were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt 
                    Elizabeth Branwell, their mother's sister. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great 
                    animal lover, being especially noted for befriending the stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside. Despite 
                    the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites 
                    included Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Shelley, and Blackwood's Magazine.<br>
                    <br>
                    In their leisure time the children began to write fiction at home, inspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had 
                    received as a gift and created a number of fantasy worlds (including 'Angria') which featured in stories they wrote – 
                    all "very strange ones" according to Charlotte – and enacted about the imaginary adventures of their toy soldiers 
                    along with the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. Little of Emily's work from this period 
                    survives, except for poems spoken by characters. When Emily was 13, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the 
                    Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two 
                    sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and 
                    place-names, the writings on Gondal were not preserved. Some "diary papers" of Emily's have survived in which she 
                    describes current events in Gondal, some of which were written, others enacted with Anne. One dates from 1841, when 
                    Emily was twenty-three: another from 1845, when she was twenty-seven. The heroes of Gondal resemble the popular image 
                    of the Highlanders of Scotland as a sort of British version of the "noble savage", being romantic outlaws who were 
                    capable of more romanticism, nobility, passion and bravery than those from "civilization". One of the fictional works 
                    produced by the Brontë siblings was Branwell's The Life of Alexander Percy, which tells the story of how he and his 
                    wife have such a complete love and understanding for one another that eventually their love becomes self-destructive. 
                    Her brother's story was to become the inspiration for Wuthering Heights.<br>
                    <br>
                    At seventeen, Emily attended the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher but managed to stay only a few 
                    months before being overcome by extreme homesickness. Charlotte later stated that: "Liberty was the breath of Emily's 
                    nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded 
                    but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what 
                    she failed in enduring... I felt in my heart she would die, if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her 
                    recall." She returned home and Anne took her place. At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education 
                    to open a small school of their own.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Personality and character</h3>
                    <br>
                    Emily Brontë remains a mysterious figure and a challenge to biographers because information about her is sparse due to her 
                    solitary and reclusive nature. Except for Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily's fellow student in Brussels, 
                    she does not seem to have made any friends outside her family. Her closest friend was her sister Anne. Together they 
                    shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, and, according to Ellen Nussey, in childhood they were "like twins", "inseparable 
                    companions" and "in the very closest sympathy which never had any interruption". In 1845 Anne took Emily to visit some 
                    of the places she had come to know and love in the five years she spent as governess. A plan to visit Scarborough fell 
                    through and instead the sisters went to York where Anne showed her sister York Minster. During the trip Emily and Anne 
                    acted out some of their Gondal characters.<br>
                    <br>
                    Charlotte Brontë remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly 
                    about her shortly after her death, she is not a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be 
                    called Charlotte's smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have 
                    doubted her sister's sanity. After Emily's death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a more 
                    acceptable (to her and the bourgeois reading public) model. Charlotte presented Emily as someone whose "natural" love of 
                    the beauties of nature had become somewhat exaggerated owning to her shy nature, making her too fond of the Yorkshire 
                    moors, and causing her to become homesick whenever she was away. According to Lucasta Miller, in her analysis of Brontë 
                    biographies, "Charlotte took on the role of Emily's first mythographer." In the Preface to the Second Edition of Wuthering 
                    Heights, in 1850, Charlotte wrote:<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>My sister's disposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion; 
                    except to go to church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the 
                    people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. 
                    And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, 
                    and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Emily's unsociability and extremely shy nature have subsequently been reported many times. According to Norma Crandall, 
                    her "warm, human aspect" was "usually revealed only in her love of nature and of animals". In a similar description, 
                    Literary news (1883) states: "[Emily] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things", and critics 
                    attest that her love of the moors is manifest in Wuthering Heights. Over the years, Emily's love of nature has been 
                    the subject of many anecdotes. A newspaper dated 31 December 1899, gives the folksy account that "with bird and beast 
                    [Emily] had the most intimate relations, and from her walks she often came with fledgling or young rabbit in hand, 
                    talking softly to it, quite sure, too, that it understood". The following anecdote is also related:<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>Once she was bitten by a dog that she saw running by in great distress, and to which she offered water. 
                    The dog was made. She said no word to any one, but herself burned the lacerated flesh to the bone with the red 
                    hot poker, and no one knew of it until the red scar was accidentally discovered some weeks after, and sympathetic 
                    questioning brought out this story.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    In Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era (1886), Eva Hope summarises Emily's character as "a peculiar mixture of 
                    timidity and Spartan-like courage", and goes on to say, "She was painfully shy, but physically she was brave to a 
                    surprising degree. She loved few persons, but those few with a passion of self-sacrificing tenderness and devotion. 
                    To other people's failings she was understanding and forgiving, but over herself she kept a continual and most austere 
                    watch, never allowing herself to deviate for one instant from what she considered her duty."`,

        "Author": "Albert Camus",
        "Biography": `<h3>Early years</h3>
                    <br>
                    Albert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in Dréan (then known as Mondovi) in French Algeria. His mother was of 
                    Spanish descent and could only hear out of her left ear. His father, Lucien, a poor agricultural worker of Alsatian 
                    descent, was wounded in the Battle of the Marne in 1914 during World War I, while serving as a member of a Zouave 
                    infantry regiment. Lucien died from his wounds in a makeshift army hospital on 11 October. Camus and his mother, an 
                    illiterate house cleaner, lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section 
                    of Algiers.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1923, Camus was accepted into the Lycée Bugeaud (fr) and eventually was admitted to the University of Algiers. 
                    After he contracted tuberculosis in 1930, he had to end his football activities; he had been a goalkeeper for a prominent 
                    Algerian university team. In addition, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private 
                    tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute. He completed his licence de philosophie (BA) in 
                    1936; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on Plotinus, "Rapports de l'hellénisme et du christianisme à travers 
                    les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin" ("Relationship of Greek and Christian thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine"), 
                    for his diplôme d'études supérieures (fr) (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis).<br>
                        <br>
                    Camus joined the French Communist Party in early 1935, seeing it as a way to "fight inequalities between Europeans and 
                    'natives' in Algeria." He did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read Das Kapital, but did write, "We might 
                    see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities." In 1936, the 
                    independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the Algerian People's 
                    Party (Le Parti du Peuple Algérien), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades, who in 1937 denounced 
                    him as a Trotskyite and expelled him from the party. Camus then became associated with the French anarchist movement.<br>
                    <br>
                    The anarchist André Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes 
                    (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications 
                    such as Le Libertaire, La révolution Prolétarienne, and Solidaridad Obrera (Workers' Solidarity), the organ of the 
                    anarcho-syndicalist CNT (National Confederation of Labor). Camus stood with the anarchists when they expressed support 
                    for the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. He again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers' 
                    uprising in Poznań, Poland, and then later in the year with the Hungarian Revolution.<br>
                    <br>
                    Camus was an agnostic. “I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.” ~Notebooks 1951-1959.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Marriage</h3>
                    <br>
                    In 1934, Camus married Simone Hié, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, 
                    he founded Théâtre du Travail (Worker's Theatre), renamed Théâtre de l'Equipe (Theatre of the Team) in 1937. It lasted 
                    until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, Alger-Républicain. His work included a report on the poor 
                    conditions for peasants in Kabylie, which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar 
                    paper, Soir-Republicain. He was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1940, Camus married Francine Faure, a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved her, he had argued passionately 
                    against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and 
                    Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage. Camus had numerous 
                    affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress María Casares. In the 
                    same year, Camus began to work for Paris-Soir magazine. In the first stage of World War II, during the so-called Phoney 
                    War, Camus was a pacifist. While in Lyon during the Wehrmacht occupation, on 15 December 1941, Camus read about the Paris 
                    execution of Gabriel Péri; it crystallized his revolt against the Germans. He moved to Bordeaux with the rest of the 
                    staff of Paris-Soir. In the same year he finished his first books, The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus. He returned 
                    briefly to Oran, Algeria, in 1942.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Death</h3>
                    <br>
                    Camus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near Sens, in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of 
                    Villeblevin. In his coat pocket was an unused train ticket. He had planned to travel by train with his wife and children, 
                    but at the last minute he accepted his publisher's proposal to travel with him.<br>
                    <br>
                    The driver of the Facel Vega HK500 car, Michel Gallimard (fr), who was Camus's publisher and close friend, died five 
                    days after the accident. In August 2011, the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported a theory that the writer had 
                    been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd (fr), did not consider it credible. Camus was 
                    buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Lourmarin, Vaucluse, France.<br>
                    <br>
                    He was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after Rudyard Kipling, at the 
                    age of 42.<br>
                    <br>
                    He was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work.<br>
                    <br>
                    Two of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled A Happy Death (1970), featured a character named 
                    Patrice Mersault, comparable to The Stranger's Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the 
                    two books. The second was an unfinished novel, The First Man (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was 
                    an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria.`,

                        traditional Mediterranean culture".He attends his mother's funeral. A few days later, he kills an 
                        Arab man in French Algiers, who was involved in a conflict with a friend. Meursault is tried and sentenced 
                        to death. The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's first-person narrative view before and 
                        after the murder, respectively.`

                        1849 following French colonization, but the novel is placed in the 1940s.[1] Oran and its environs were struck by 
                        disease multiple times before Camus published this novel. According to a research report by the Centers for Disease 
                        Control and Prevention, Oran was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678, but all later outbreaks, in 1921 (185 cases), 
                        1931 (76 cases), and 1944 (95 cases), were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel.`

            "Genre": "novel",
            "Summary": `The Fall (French: La Chute) is a philosophical novel by Albert Camus. First published in 1956, it is his last complete 
                        work of fiction. Set in Amsterdam, The Fall consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed "judge-penitent" 
                        Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of 
                        his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues; his crisis, and his ultimate 
                        "fall" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden. The Fall explores themes 
                        of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth. In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre 
                        described the novel as "perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood" of Camus' books.`
